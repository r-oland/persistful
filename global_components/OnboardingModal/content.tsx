          Let's see if this might sound familiar: There are a couple of things
          in your life that you enjoy doing or/and that you want to do more of.
          Maybe it's reading, exercising, or doing passion projects, you can
          probably think of a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, strangely enough, you don't get around to doing those things as
          much as you would like to.

          There are probably also a couple of things that you want to do less
          off, am I right?

          Maybe your bank account always seems to drain a little faster than you
          care to admit? Been there! Started smoking again while you promised
          yourself to quit? Yikes... You probably assembled yourself a nice
          collection over the years.

          Persistful is designed around the idea of getting more consistency
          into your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done by setting a daily goal for yourself. This goal can be
          reached by performing (or not performing) a set of activities. Once
          you reached your daily goal, you will build up a streak. This streak
          will allow you to earn rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start by setting your activities. I already gave you some
          activity examples to help you get started. Enjoy and good luck!
