          Let's see if this might sound familiar: There are a couple of things
          in your life that you enjoy doing or that you wan't to do more of. Yet
          strangely enough, you don't really get around to doing those things as
          much as you would like to.
        </p>

          Maybe you like to keep sharp with a good book, fancy yourself a bit of
          musician or you love the satisfied feeling that you get after a nice
          sweaty workout. Take a moment to think what might fall into this
          category for you.

          Now that you have a couple of things that you wan't to do more of,
          their are probably a couple things that you also wan't to do less.

          Maybe endlessly scrolling on social media sounds like a familiar
          problem? Yikes! Do you find yourself reaching for some delicious
          junk-food just a little to often? Who hasn't been there.. Reflect on
          this as well.

          Persistful is made to help you in becoming more consistent in doing
          more of the things that you wan't to do and doing less of the things
          that you don't.

          This is done with a carrot-and-stick method of tracking both good and
          bad habits. You can set a goal of what you minimally want to achieve
          in a day. If you achieved this goal, you will build up a streak. Build
          enough of a streak? Then you can treat yourself with a reward that
          tickles your fancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start by setting your activities. I already gave you some
          examples to help you get started. Enjoy and good luck!
